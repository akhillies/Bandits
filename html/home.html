	<h2 class="subtitle">The 5 W's</h2>


	<h3 class="subtitle">WHO:</h3>
	<p class="text">We are all students at UC Berkeley studying various things (from Computer Science to Chemical Engineering to Art to Philosophy) but all interested in animation.</p>

	<h3 class="subtitle">WHAT:</h3>
	<p class="text">All of us have banded together to create a 30 second animation short called Bandits. The original pitch is here: http://youtu.be/Xrfh-khNMbA, but the story is forever evolving - going through animatics and critique sessions have made a lot of things change from the original story.</p>

	<h3 class="subtitle">WHY:</h3>
	<p class="text">This is part of a class known as CNM 190 or CS 194-2. While it may seem to be an assignment, everyone in this class had to essentially "try-out" and show their dedication and love of animation before being accepted. We are people who would probably do this in our spare time if given the chance - at least now we can use it as a legitimate excuse for not doing other things :D.</p>

	<h3 class="subtitle">HOW:</h3>
	<p class="text">We are using a variety of design tools, but mainly AutoDesk Maya for the 3D modeling / animation and Adobe Photoshop for pre-production work (character design and animatics).</p>
