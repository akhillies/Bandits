	<h3 id="pitchtitle">So, how did it all start? Well Stephanie came up with a brilliant story starting along the lines of:</h3>
	<p id="pitchtext">There’s a raccoon dressed as a spy perched in the branches of a tree, not blinking, clearly watching for something. He sees something and whispers in a walkie-talkie. The scene changes inside the house, where we see two other raccoons on their hind legs appraising various shiny objects. When they hear the walkie-talkie sound, they immediately begin grabbing things and leaving the house. We then see other raccoons from all over the house stealing things like socks from the dryer or cat food and leaving through open windows. As they all crawl out, we see humans exit from a car in the driveway and enter the house. Later we hear a boy asking “where did all my socks go?” After the end credits, we see the raccoons all chilling in their den, where they have used all the stolen goods as furniture.</p>
